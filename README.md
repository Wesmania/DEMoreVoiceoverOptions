# Reverse Psychological VO for Disco Elysium

Enables only voiceover that's in the "Full" setting, but not in the "Psychological" setting.
* In other words, enables full skills VO, but not full NPC VO.
* In yet other words, Reverse Physhological VO = Classic VO + (Full VO - Psychological VO).

## Installation

* Install BepInEx.
* Download a release from the releases page and dump it into BepInEx/plugins.
* No automated installation method, I'm lazy. Pull requests welcome!

## Rationale

When I first played DE, I ended up with some sort of a bug where all skills
would be voiced, but NPC would only get introductory VO. I really liked it,
since it really made skills stand out while not drowning me with voiced
dialogue. To my disappointment, the bug was fixed at some point, hence this
mod.
